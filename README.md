# 🕰️ LunethWatch: Time-Synchronized Blockchain Risk Monitoring

**LunethWatch** is a lightweight AI-powered tool designed to monitor blockchain risk through the lens of time.  
By aligning transaction data with real-world timing, LunethWatch helps detect latency-based anomalies, trend shifts, and signal inconsistencies — all in real time.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 👁 WatchfulEye  
Continuously monitors the flow and timestamp of blockchain transactions to detect latency, network congestion, and suspicious delays that may indicate manipulation.

### 📉 RiskRadar  
Analyzes liquidity exposure, slippage, and volatility to flag high-risk transactions before they execute.

### 📡 SignalGuard  
Separates strong, actionable signals from noise using a proprietary trust-strength framework, helping users focus on meaningful data.

### ⛓ ChainSync  
Ensures on-chain transaction timestamps are aligned with real-world time standards, preventing drift and timing exploits.

### 📊 TrendTrack  
Identifies early signs of trend reversals or micro-pumps by tracking liquidity waves and price velocity in short intervals.

## 🧠 AI Modules

LunethWatch is powered by a series of intelligent detection systems. Each module is built to identify subtle anomalies and timing-based risks across the blockchain.


### 1. 👁 WatchfulEye — Continuous Blockchain Monitoring  
**📡 Language:** JavaScript

```javascript
function watchfulEye(blockchainData) {
  const timestampDeviation = Math.abs(blockchainData.timestamp - Date.now());
  const frequencyFactor = blockchainData.transactionFrequency / blockchainData.totalTransactions;

  const monitoringScore = (timestampDeviation + frequencyFactor) / 2;

  if (monitoringScore > 2000) {
    return 'Alert: Blockchain Monitoring Deviation Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Blockchain Monitoring Stable';
  }
}
```
#### Performs constant surveillance on transaction flow and timing. Detects latency, congestion, or tampering by analyzing timestamp deviation and activity frequency.

### 2. ⚠️ RiskRadar — Real-Time Risk Detection

```python
def risk_radar(transaction_data):
    risk_threshold = 0.4
    liquidity_score = transaction_data['amount'] / transaction_data['total_transactions']
    price_impact = transaction_data['price_change'] / transaction_data['previous_price']

    total_risk = liquidity_score * price_impact

    if total_risk > risk_threshold:
        return 'Alert: High Blockchain Risk Detected'
    else:
        return 'Blockchain Risk Low'
```
#### Evaluates real-time transaction risk using liquidity impact and price volatility. Detects flash pumps, low-liquidity traps, and whale moves.

### 3. 📡 SignalGuard — Market Signal Verification

```javascript
function signalGuard(signalData) {
  const signalStrength = signalData.signalValue * signalData.reliabilityFactor;
  const alertThreshold = 150;

  if (signalStrength > alertThreshold) {
    return 'Alert: Strong Market Signal Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Signal Weak';
  }
}
```
#### Filters real signals from noise. Uses strength × reliability to determine whether a signal is actionable or should be ignored.

### 4. ⛓ ChainSync — Temporal Synchronization Engine

```python
import time

def chain_sync(transaction_data):
    sync_error = abs(transaction_data['timestamp'] - int(time.time() * 1000))
    sync_threshold = 5000

    if sync_error > sync_threshold:
        return 'Alert: Blockchain Synchronization Error'
    else:
        return 'Blockchain Synchronized'
```
#### Validates transaction timestamps against system time. Raises alerts on out-of-sync behavior to detect RPC drift or manipulation.

### 5. 📊 TrendTrack — Predictive Trend Detector

```javascript
function trendTrack(marketData) {
  const priceChangePercentage = (marketData.currentPrice - marketData.previousPrice) / marketData.previousPrice;
  const marketDepth = marketData.volumeChange / marketData.marketLiquidity;

  let trendPrediction = priceChangePercentage * marketDepth;

  if (trendPrediction > 0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Upward Trend Detected';
  } else if (trendPrediction < -0.1) {
    return 'Alert: Downward Trend Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Market Neutral';
  }
}
```
#### Detects early market trend reversals and liquidity-driven price shifts. Helps identify pumps or dumps before they go public.
